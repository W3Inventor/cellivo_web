        <p>We want you to be completely satisfied with Cellivo. This Refund Policy outlines the terms under which refunds are provided for our subscription plans.</p>

        <h2>1. Free Plan</h2>
        <p>The Cellivo free plan requires no payment. No refund applies.</p>

        <h2>2. Paid Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with your paid subscription, you may request a full refund within <strong className="text-foreground">14 days</strong> of your initial purchase or renewal. Refund requests made after 14 days will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

        <h2>3. How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <p>To request a refund, contact our support team at <a href="mailto:hello@cellivo.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">hello@cellivo.com</a> with your account email and reason for the request. We aim to process all refund requests within 5–7 business days.</p>

        <h2>4. Annual Plans</h2>
        <p>For annual subscriptions, refunds are available within 14 days of purchase. After 14 days, you may cancel your plan and continue using the service until the end of your billing period. No partial refunds are provided for unused months unless required by law.</p>

        <h2>5. Upgrades & Downgrades</h2>
        <p>If you upgrade your plan, the price difference is prorated. If you downgrade, the new rate applies at the start of your next billing cycle. No refund is issued for the current cycle upon downgrade.</p>

        <h2>6. Exceptions</h2>
        <p>Refunds will not be provided in cases of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account termination due to violation of our Terms of Service</li>
          <li>Failure to cancel before a renewal date</li>
          <li>Dissatisfaction with features clearly described before purchase</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Chargebacks</h2>
        <p>If you initiate a chargeback instead of contacting us, your account may be suspended pending investigation. We encourage you to reach out to our support team first so we can resolve any issues directly.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this refund policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>For refund requests or questions, email us at <a href="mailto:hello@cellivo.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">hello@cellivo.com</a>.</p>
